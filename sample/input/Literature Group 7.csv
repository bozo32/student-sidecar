"As explained in the introduction, the concept of ‘business models’ is broad, and one common definition is lacking ","Alonso et al. (2007), ","The importance of raw material availability is obvious to upstream firms that extract, refine, and process material into products. However, as this paper will demonstrate, materials availability is critical to all firms. If raw materials become difficult to acquire, market forces may shift demand to other goods and therefore other supply chains. Regardless of one's specific business, such shifts can lead to irreparable economic harm. Unfortunately, post facto responses are limited by the far-reaching effects of materials. Materials establish ap propriate production technologies and the possible config uration of the supply chain. The extent of these effects means that solely reactive response will be limited and may be ineffective.",

Today, success is not dependent on product innovation alone, but also on business model innovation, and open innovation [12] is the starting point of new business model development [13].",
"As explained in the introduction, the concept of ‘business models’ is broad, and one common definition is lacking ","Nielsen & Lund, 2014","ing business models can to some extent be traced to the fact that new value configurations outcompete existing ways of doing business. There exist cases where some businesses are more profitable than others in the same industry, even though they apply the same strategy. This illustrates that a business model is different from a competitive strategy and a value chain. A value chain is a set of serially performed activities for a firm in a specific industry. The difference thus lies in the way activities are
performed (strategic and tactical choices), and therefore a business model is closely connected to a
management control agenda. The business model
perspective has also been found useful for aligning
financial and non-financial performance measures
with strategy and goals. In addition, communicative
aspects from executive management to the rest of the
