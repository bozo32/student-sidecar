"Shifts in material sourcing, such as reliance on lower-grade domestic raw material, would reduce processing capacity, and as a response to that, alternative technological solutions are adopted to account for these changes. ",Alonso et al. (2010),"When manufacturers experience shifts in material sourcing, they start to adopt new technologies. Such as:"" These strategies include (1) improving production efficiency, (2) developing technology to use more sustainable substitute materials, and (3) facilitating a more effective materials recycling infrastructure.""  ""Overall, as prices rose, the supply chain responded through materials substitution and development of new technology, source relocation, hoarding and rationing, supply mode changes, and recycling.""

 Alternative Rejection of R&D Expenditure. Suggested that R&D spending does not accurately predict the implementation of new technologies,Kleinknecht et al. (2002),"""the two most commonly used indicators (R&D and patent applications) have more (and more severe) weaknesses than is often assumed.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10438590210899
"Therefore, R&D expenditure is an indirect way to track the number and type of technology adoption.",Gelebo et al. (2015) ,"distinguished between frontier innovation, which is measured by R&D spending, and adaptation of existing technologies, showing these are two separate indicators predicting different processes.
