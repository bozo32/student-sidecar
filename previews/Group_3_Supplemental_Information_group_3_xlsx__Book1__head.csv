"This study will focus on macroplastics, namely categories 4, 5, 6, and 7, being the most abundant and at the center of our researc",Hendrawan et al 2023.pdf,"Fig. 4. The count of (a) debris in each size class: 1 (0–1 cm2), 2 (1–2 cm2), 3 (2–4 cm2), 4 (4–8 cm2), 5 (8–16 cm2), 6 (16–21 cm2) and 7 (>22 cm2), and the (b) percentage of debris for both whole and fragmented items at NMPA and NTBB survey sites, combined."
"Following the example of related literature, to determine the amount of MMD in each grid cell i, a contamination factor CFi will be used. This will be calculated by dividing the observed contamination at the site Ci with a reference background contamination factor Cb","De et al, 2022.pdf"," the PLI at each mangrove stand was computed based on the particular plastic debris contamination factors (CF), which is the quotient of the plastic debris density at each mangrove location (Cl) /background value of the plastic debris (Cb)"
"Following the example of related literature, to determine the amount of MMD in each grid cell i, a contamination factor CFi will be used. This will be calculated by dividing the observed contamination at the site Ci with a reference background contamination factor Cb",Panda et al. - 2026 - Evaluating the ecological risks of marine litter and derelict fishing nets on Olive Ridley hatchling.pdf,"In this study, we applied the PLI to measure macroplastic pollution levels on the nesting beaches. The index compares plastic litter at each site (Ci) with a background reference (Co) 
Here, “i” stands for a specific sampling station, and “n” is the total number of stations."
"Fishermen predominantly catch coral reef fish species, which mostly remain within reef ecosystems without migration",Prihatiningsih_2023_IOP_Conf._Ser.__Earth_Environ._Sci._1137_012020.pdf,"""Reef fish are fish that spend the majority of their lives in coral reef ecosystems. The more living coral
cover there is, the more fish there are. Their movement is not too far, activity is low, and schools are not too
large, resulting in a relatively even distribution compared to pelagic fish"""
